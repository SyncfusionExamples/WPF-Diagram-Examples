# Selector Constraints sample
This repository contains sample which illustrates how to add or remove specific selector constraints.

Selector visually represents the selected elements with certain editable thumbs such as rotator, resizer and quickcommands in [WPF Diagram](https://www.syncfusion.com/wpf-controls/diagram) (SfDiagram). The visual representation of these thumbs can be controlled with SelectorConstraints.
