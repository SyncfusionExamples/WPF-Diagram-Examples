# Force Directed Tree Layout sample
This sample demonstrate how to create a simple Force Directed Tree Layout using [WPF Diagram](https://www.syncfusion.com/wpf-controls/diagram) (SfDiagram).

A force-directed layout algorithm uses a physics simulation (virtual spring-like forces and electrical repulsion) to arrange nodes in a graph. This approach automatically positions nodes to minimize edge crossings and visual clutter, making complex relationships easier to understand.
