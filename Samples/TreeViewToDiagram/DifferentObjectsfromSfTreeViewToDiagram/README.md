# Drag and Drop from SfTreeView to diagram sample
This sample demonstrates how to drag and drop different shaped objects from SfTreeView element to [WPF Diagram](https://www.syncfusion.com/wpf-controls/diagram) (SfDiagram).

The DragEnter event is used to achieve this drag and drop by changing the unknown object to a known object that is predefined diagram types.
